# DSA-Tracker-Java 🚀

This repository is my **personal Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice tracker in Java**.  
I use it to practice problems, track progress, and revise concepts regularly while preparing for **software developer interviews**.

The goal of this repository is **consistency, clarity, and improvement**, not just solving problems.
