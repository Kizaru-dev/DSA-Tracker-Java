🔹 What is Hashing? (in very simple words)

Hashing = putting things in the right box so you can find them fast.

Imagine this 👇

You have 1000 books.
If someone asks:

“Do you have the book Harry Potter?”

❌ Without hashing

You check one book at a time → very slow 😫

✅ With hashing

You already know:

Books starting with H go in Box H

So you directly open Box H → fast ⚡

That box finding logic is called hashing.

🔹 Hash Function (don’t panic 😄)

A hash function is just a rule that decides:

“This item should go in which box?”

Example:

key = "Apple"
hashCode = 203948
index = hashCode % 10  →  box 8


📌 You don’t write this logic in Java — Java does it for you.

🔹 What is HashMap?

HashMap stores data as → (key, value)

Real-life example 🪪

Think of an Aadhaar card system:

Aadhaar Number → Person Name

1234 → Rahul
5678 → Priyanshu


Here:

Key = Aadhaar Number (unique)

Value = Person Name

Simple Java Example (HashMap)
HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();

map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(2, "Banana");
map.put(3, "Mango");

System.out.println(map.get(2)); // Banana


📌 Why is this fast?
Because Java uses hashing to directly jump to the correct box.

Important HashMap Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

✔ Keys are unique
❌ Values can repeat
✔ Fast searching
✔ Order is NOT fixed

Example:

map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(1, "Orange"); // Apple is replaced

🔹 How HashMap Works Internally (in 1 picture explanation)

Simple flow:

Key → hashCode → index → bucket → value


You don’t need more depth as a beginner 👍

🔹 What is HashSet?

HashSet stores ONLY values (no key)
And it never allows duplicates.

Real-life example 🎟️

Movie tickets:

Seat A1

Seat A2

Seat A1 ❌ (duplicate, not allowed)

Simple Java Example (HashSet)
HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();

set.add("Apple");
set.add("Banana");
set.add("Apple"); // ignored

System.out.println(set);


Output:

[Apple, Banana]


📌 Why Apple not added twice?
Because HashSet uses hashing to check duplicates.

🔹 How HashSet Works (Simple logic)

Behind the scenes:

value → hashCode → check bucket
If already exists → reject


📌 Fun fact (for interview):

HashSet is internally backed by a HashMap

🔹 HashMap vs HashSet (Super Easy Table)
Feature	HashMap	HashSet
Stores	Key + Value	Only Value
Duplicate allowed	❌ key	❌
Use case	Data mapping	Unique values
Fast lookup	✅	✅
🔹 When should YOU use them? (Practical)
Use HashMap when:

✔ You need mapping
✔ Example:

UserID → UserData

RollNo → StudentName

Email → Password

Use HashSet when:

✔ You only care about uniqueness
✔ Example:

Unique emails

Unique usernames

Unique visited pages

🔹 One-Line Summary (Remember this 👇)

Hashing helps Java find data very fast using boxes.
HashMap stores key-value pairs.
HashSet stores unique values only.

🔹 Beginner Interview Question (Must Remember)

❓ Why HashMap and HashSet are fast?
✔ Because they use hashing instead of searching one-by-one.
